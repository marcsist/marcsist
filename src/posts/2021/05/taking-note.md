## Thanks for looking

I'm Marcs, a digital and physical product designer working my way through every type of product I can think of.

Right now I'm working for Phrase, an l10n and i18n company based in Hamburg, Germany. Since I have a job, I figured it was a good a time as any to take down my old portfolio and try something new.

## Rolling my own

I decided it was high time to take control of my own sites, having spent years bending to the will of different WYSWIGY portfolio editors.

I'm trying to shift my work too - from a collection of design projects that didn't really end up doing anything -> to a repository of real things I've done that hopefully live in the world.

We'll see how it goes, I guess!
