## Unlearning website builders
One of the reasons I built this website was to transition off of WYSIWYG web editors.

-  My [personal portfolio](https://marcsw.myportfolio.com) was built with Adobe Portfolio
-  I made the landing site for my studio [BIEM ETC design](https://www.biemetc.com) on Adobe's tool too
-  When I committed to the [Les Original](https://www.lesorignal.com) domain I acted on a promotion from Mailchip.. they seem to own it more than I do.
-  Before leaving Canada I used an old Square cardreader login to set up shop at [lesoriginal.square.site](https://lesoriginal.square.site)
-  I've built all sorts of blogs and sites on Tumblr since way back
    -  [product of failures](https://prodoffailures.tumblr.com/)
    -  [marcsist for people](https://marcsoriginal.tumblr.com/)
    
And that's just what's left.

## Something different, something familiar
Something always draws me back to trying to make an interesting site using [notion](https://www.notion.so) and I'm at it again. My current visa prevents me from operating a commercial venture while living in Germany. For that reason, my Les Original will focus on building community, free and open designs.

I've started to set up a Notion site that I'll use as a showcase and documentation. Why Notion? I like the flexibility, no cost to rearrange and change things as I see fit. I'd also LOVE to get some comments on the pages I set up.

## I'm not paying for a custom domain on Square!
It was a fine builder (they may have bought Wix?) with blog-like feature (called Stories) but at this point I don't know what I'd do if a purchase came through on it.. bite the bullet and ship this [ol' rice bag](https://www.notion.so/marcsist/Lantern-cover-b83505cadfb343cf9eaf58779c31a102) around the world I guess.

My next steps are to delete the online shop, and try to sort out some domain parking with Mailchip. I don't think it supports nameservers, redirects or anythign super useful, but since I'm not a business that's OKAY!
