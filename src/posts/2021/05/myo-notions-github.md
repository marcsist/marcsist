## GitHub - FANTASTIC
I'd always been into the idea of GitHub as I *walked the line* of technical understanding. I interacted with it often enough, and even got familiar with Git in a SuperHi [command line course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/command-line-for-creatives). But I was today years old when I realized they had a full Jira and beyond. It's even better, because the components and currency of the product has been so elegantly integrated in a flexible way.  

I was really excited about [Linear](linear.app/), but after today it's feeling more like this is the tool for the job. Even the aptly named [Notion](https://www.notion.so/marcsist/MYO-Notions-6e98b11a9ec54a45b88b3f215b6a5233) seems like it could become a bit cumbersome if things pick up.

## MYO Notions on GitHub
I learned this while stepping up the [*MYO Notions* repo](https://www.github.com/les-original/myo-notions). I set up a [Project](https://www.github.com/les-original/myo-notions/projects/1) for tracking new components and [testing](https://www.github.com/les-original/myo-notions/projects/2), a [wiki](https://www.github.com/les-original/myo-notions/wiki), and stubbed in some [discussions](https://www.github.com/les-original/myo-notions/discussions) based on a release.

I also created some issues and marked them for a Q2 milestone. I'm committed to making some beads (Great first issue!) and a little webbing hook. Without actually modeling a notion, I feel exhilirated and my energy levels for the project are high. Even more, thanks to GitHub's org-wide project feature (which connects nicely to repo projects) I'm feeling a whole new level of excitement about open collaboration and building more les original projects out in the open.

Let's just pray she holds. üôè
