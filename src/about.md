  <h2>Creative technologist from Canada living in Germany, designing and managing products for humans doing things in new ways.</h2>

I user-center today's problems and complex challenges into solutions of the near-future. Right now I'm working to improve the experience of #L10N and #I18N for software, and crafting odds and open-source ends.

I've worked alongside researchers and engineers to turn research into real products. As a designer I work at the intersection of technology and tangibles, resolving new product experiences and interactions. More recently I've cut my teeth as a product leader making B2B SaaS for the enterprise.

In my spare time I design and make quirky things with my sewing machines and a 3D printer, exploring themes of digital manufacturing, circular design, product lifecycles and technical crafts. Mostly things to help me get outside, or stuff I need that nobody else is foolish enough to make.

I've been building up and riding bikes since I was a kid. Lately I've been tuning and tinkering between rides throughout Nova Scotia. I take any chance I can to pop into bike/ski shops and outdoor stores to examine new gear but I try my best not to buy anything. I especially like to geek out on construction of textiles and footwear.

Hiking, biking, camping and skiing are how I stretch my legs. When the world is agreeable, I like to travel around and experience it, especially natural beauty and the fruits of human creativity. My last big move was across Canada for a fellowship, and now I'm in Germany working on cool things.
