# Hello Friendo!

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a simple static site generator. That means you get all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files. I'm using Eleventy as an engine for my project.


## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `public/index.css`: The styling rules for your pages and posts.

← `src/`: This folder contains all the files Eleventy will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder 📁

← `src/index.md`, `src/posts.md`, `src/about.md`: These Markdown files are the content for your Home, Posts, and About pages.

← `src/posts/`: These are the Markdown files for the posts that make up your blog.

← `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

← `src/_includes`: This is where all of your page level layouts go. The **\_** tells you that this is an _eleventy only_ folder.


## I built this with Glitch!
