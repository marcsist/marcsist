# Call me Marcs!

I'm Marcs, a product designer and builder from Canada, currently living and working in Hamburg, Germany. When I'm not trying to make software better, I work on physical goods - crafty outdoor products for biking and camping.

I've set up this blog to share the things I've built and contributed to.
