# Call me Marcs!

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a simple static site generator. That means you get all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files. I'm using Eleventy as an engine for my personal website.

## I built this with Glitch!

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a friendly community where millions of people come together to build web apps and websites.
